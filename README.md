Prime Solo Project - Creating a Base Project
Explain each of the components of your projects

BaseProject-Master Directory: is the new directory created via the command line and housed in a specified drive. This BaseProject-Master directory was created as a baseline to illustrate the basic file structure for web application projects.

Git Repository: Git symbol indicates the presence of (in this example) an initialized Github repository. This initialized repo is created with the git init command. This command creates the repository. It can also be used to convert an existing, unversioned project to a Git repository as well as initialize a new empty repository. Most of the other Git commands are not available outside of an initialized repository, so this is usually the first command you'll run in a new project.

index.html: Is the common default page shown on a website if no other page is specified.

app.js: Is where all your scripts are housed, access scripts by linking your app.js to your index.html file.

styles.css: CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.

README.md: A readme (or read me) file contains information about other files in a directory or archive and is commonly distributed with computer software, forming part of its documentation. Such a file is usually a text file called README.TXT, README.md, README.1ST, READ.ME, or simply README, although some software may occasionally include a README.WRI, README.RTF, or README.DOC. The name is chosen so that users unaware of the existence of this type of file would be drawn to read it.

Instructions:
Creating base projects is something that will serve you well. With what you
know now, we are going to create a build that encompasses the basics. We will
be adding onto it throughout the program, so while considering this setup process,
ensure you pick a repo name that represents what will happen throughout the program.

“Base Project” is a name that would work well in this case.

Here are the steps that need to be completed in the allotted time:

* Create a new repository on GitHub
* Create a new project (folder in this case) on your machine
* Initialize a Git repository in that project
* Create an index.html and populate it with base functionality for an html page
* Create an app.js file that will serve as your functionality for your site
  make sure in comments to include the Author and Date of creation
* Create a stylesheet.css, no population of content needed at this time
* Link the Javascript and CSS file to your HTML file
* Check this project into GitHub
* Create a README Markdown file and explain each of the components of your projects//
